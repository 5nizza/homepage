Reactive synthesis seeks to create systems from their behaviors,
But the quest focuses on Booleans, neglecting the world's varied flavors.
Bit-vectors and integers, oh my!
Bit-blasting makes them unreadable, forcing us to sigh.
Register transducers, a step closer to the goal,
Store data in registers, outputting what they stole.
But prior research claimed undecidability,
Due to the unbounded queue's insatiability.
Our work proves that by limiting the number of registers in play,
The problem becomes solvable without further delay.
And using quantified temporal logic to specify,
Automata are replaced, their usefulness we can now deny.
